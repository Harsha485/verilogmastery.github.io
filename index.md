# Welcome to Verilog Mastery
Building the next generation of Hardware Engineers.

## Lesson 1: What is a Module?
In Verilog, everything starts with a module. Think of it like a chip.

### Example Code:
```verilog
module hello_world(
    input wire clk,
    output reg led
);
    // Your logic goes here
endmodule
